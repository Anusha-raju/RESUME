## DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS

------

- [Ratings Categorizer](https://github.com/Anusha-raju/Ratings_classifier) **–** Upon performing **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** obtain insights on significant parameters & build a classifier that’s capable of categorizing the App’s ratings.
  - Techniques**: *Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random forest***
  - Languages: **Python**
  - Summary: Random Forest gave much better accuracy scores than Logistic Regression

- [Reviews Classifier](https://github.com/Anusha-raju/Reviews_classifier) **–** To classify the reviews into positive and negative based on the overall text tone of the review.
  - Techniques**: *Naïve-Bayes , NLP***
  - Languages: **Python**
  - Summary: “**Bag of Words”** method was used to obtain tokens and Naïve-Bayes classifier performed well
- [Rent Prediction](https://github.com/Anusha-raju/House-Rent-Data-Analysis) **–** To predict the rent of homes based on various parameters.
  - Techniques**: *KNN, Decision Tree, Random forest***
  - Languages: **Python**
  - Summary: Upon successive EDA and Data cleaning, the model was trained. Models prediction on test data was significantly better on ‘Hyperparameter *optimization of RandomForest’*
